Sonnenhut 1.0.1
===============

A simple Python script for photographers that displays basic information such
as current weather conditions and golden hour for a specified location.

The script provides the following information:

-  Golden hour start and duration
-  Brief weather summary
-  Current temperature, wind speed, and humidity
-  Precipitation warning

The script also shows notes from the accompanying *sonnenhut.txt* file
(created automatically during the fist run).
